# option-vol-surface
We are going to visualize option vol surfaces and use historical vols to predict mean-reverting tendencies.

Rough Starting Plan
- Pull data from IB, Yahoo Finance, or Google Finance
- Focused on Closing Information and multi-day hold times
- Will eventually use open interest to understand vol surface movements
- Finally get some data intraday to understand momentum
-







Worked done by Kunal and Karun Koppula.
